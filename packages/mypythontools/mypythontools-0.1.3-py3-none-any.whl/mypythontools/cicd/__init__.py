"""Module with functionality around Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

Subpackages

- build
- deploy
- project_utils
- tests

In project utils you can find many functions for CI/CD, but also pipelining functions that will call them
in defined order.

Why to use this and not Travis or Circle CI? It's local and it's fast. You can setup it as a task in IDE and
if some phase fails, you know it soon and before pushing to repo.

You can also import mypythontools in your CI/CD and use it there of course.
