Test Suite and automation
=========================

A series of unit and integration tests are run automatically with every pull
request or merge to the Github repository. Running the tests locally is also
possible by running pytest within a cloned Paramak repo. The testing
dependencies may be installed alongside Paramak by calling:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .[tests]

Running the tests locally simply requires:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests

Similarly, the examples notebooks may be tested by calling:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pytest examples_tests

The status of the tests is available on the CircleCI account
`CircleCI account. <https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/fusion-energy/paramak?branch=main>`_ 

The test suite can be explored on the
`Gihub source code repository. <https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak/tree/main/tests>`_ 

In addition to automated tests we also have automated code style formatting
using  `autopep8 and Github Actions. <https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak/actions?query=workflow%3Aautopep8>`_ 

Continuing the theme of automation we also have automated distribution updates.
The distribution is performed by `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ and this is kept
up to date using Github Actions
`(upload python package) <https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Upload+Python+Package%22>`_ 
which trigger on every merge to the main branch.

There are also plans for a continuously updated Dockerhub image in the pipeline.
