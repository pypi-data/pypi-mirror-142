# Shuvel
Unearthing bad code. Performs regex searches, but with more manageable results.

## Installation
### Standard Build
`pip3 install shuvel`

### Bleeding Edge Build
`pip3 install git+https://gitlab.com/TheTwitchy/shuvel`

### Development
* It is recommended that you use a virtualenv for development:
    * `virtualenv --python python3 venv`
    * `source ./venv/bin/activate`
* `python setup.py develop`
* Run with `shuvel`

## Usage
### Running Rulesets
* `shuvel run -t ~/example/src`
    * Runs all rules.
* `shuvel run -t ~/example/src -r general.*`
    * Runs all rules in the `general` category.
* `shuvel run -t ~/example/src -r general.security_words`
    * Runs only the rule `general.security_words`.
* `shuvel run -t ~/example/src -r general.security_words,general.rng,other.*`
    * Runs several rules at once.
* `shuvel run -t ~/example/src -s low`
    * Only run rules which will report low severity items or higher. Possible values are `high`, `low`, and `info`. 

### Showing Rulesets
* `shuvel rules` 
    * Shows all loaded rules.

## Writing Rules
Rules are stored locally, and can generally be found in the `shuvel` config directory, which can be seen when running `shuvel run --help`. Non-default rules directories may be specified on the command line with the `-r` option. Rules need to be JSON files which have a structure as shown below (specifically the magic number should be intact, and all rules should be defined as a list under the "rules" field).

### Example Rules
See the `examples` folder for some possibilities.

### Testing Rules
To ensure a rule is valid, run `shuvel test` to show any errors or suggestions. The `--debug` switch can be passed before the `test` command as well for additional output.
