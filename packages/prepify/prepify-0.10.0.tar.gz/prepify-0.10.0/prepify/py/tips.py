The use of this option should be exeedingly rare.
When the "Supplemental" checkbox is NOT ticked, it
will result in the existence of either more 'a' side
images or more 'b' side images. I.e., you will be
creating an 'a' without a 'b' or vice versa.

If "Supplemental" is ticked, then the single folio
side will be treated as a continuation of the previous
folio. E.g., "5.1a, 5.2a". A "Supplemental" single
folio side will not increase the total number of
distinct folia, but it will increase the number
of images.

Both options will add complexitity. Please be
certain this is the best way to record the data.
It is advised to check the spreadsheet to see
how the addition of a single folio side
will affect the imaging team.
