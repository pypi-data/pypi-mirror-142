    Command syntax and format:
        - commands and parameters are transmitted as capital letters
        - commands and parameters including successive parameters are seperated by at least one space (hex 0x20)
        - each individual command (including parameters and data and each response are terminated with
          Blank CR LF (hex 0x0d hex 0x0A) and have a maximum length of 80 characters
        - the decimal separator in a number is a dt (hex 0x2E)
    About watchdog:
        watchdog functions monitors the serial data flow. if, once this function has been activated there is no
        retransmission of the command from the computer within the set time ("watchog time:), the tempering and
        pump functions are switched off in accordance with the set "watchdog" function or are changed to the set
        target values. data transmission may be interrupted by, for example, a crash in the operating system,
        a power failure in the pc, or an issue with the connection table between the computer and the device
        watchdog mode 1
            - if there is an interruption in data communications (longer than the set watchdog time), the tempering
            and pump functions are switched off and Error 2 is displayed

            - if there is an interruption in data communications (longer than the set watchdog time), speed target
            value is changed to the WD safety speed limit and the temperature target value is changed to the WD
            safety temperature value. error message Error 2 is displayed
