A Lavalink client library written for Python 3.9 and 3.10 using the AsyncIO
framework. This is a fork of
[Red-Lavalink](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-Lavalink) optimized to work with Useless Bot.

To install:
``` bash
pip install useless_lavalink
```

# Usage

``` python
import lavalink
from discord.ext.commands import Bot

bot = Bot()


@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    await lavalink.initialize(bot)
    await lavalink.add_node(
        bot, host='localhost', password='password',  ws_port=2333
    )


async def search_and_play(voice_channel, search_terms):
    player = await lavalink.connect(voice_channel)
    tracks = await player.search_yt(search_terms)
    player.add(tracks[0])
    await player.play()
```

# Shuffling

``` python
def shuffle_queue(player_id, forced=True):
    player = lavalink.get_player(player_id)
    if not forced:
        player.maybe_shuffle(sticky_songs=0)
        """
        `player.maybe_shuffle` respects `player.shuffle`
        And will only shuffle if `player.shuffle` is True.

        `player.maybe_shuffle` should be called every time
        you would expect the queue to be shuffled.

        `sticky_songs=0` will shuffle every song in the queue.
        """
    else:
        player.force_shuffle(sticky_songs=3)
        """
        `player.force_shuffle` does not respect `player.shuffle`
        And will always shuffle the queue.

        `sticky_songs=3` will shuffle every song after the first 3 songs in the queue.
        """
```

When shutting down, be sure to do the following:
``` python
await lavalink.close(bot)
```
