# Squirrel
**Very much a WIP project**

squirrel is a command line program that tracks you writing progress.
The program can tell you:
* How many days are left before due-date.
* How many words you've wrote each day.
* ...

## How it works
Squirrel's design was inspired by `git`'s design (from a user perspective at least). To start a project, you have to initialize a new project in your directory of choice, which will create a `.squirrel` folder structure in your directory similar to `.git` directories.
That folder will store:
* project metadata (e.g name, description, goal, due date, etc.).
* word counts.

However `squirrel` is not a static program otherwise we couldn't track progress without explicit input of the user.
The `watch` command will listen to any changes and update the count.

### Plugins or Project Types
Many people use different file formats and software to write.
The behaviour of `squirrel` can be changed with plugins to fit particular needs.
The `project-type` field set by the users determines which plugin will be used.

Plugins available now:
* text
* texcount

*hmm, haven't found your project type? you can write Python code? Please make a pull request :)*

## Requirement & Installation
**Tested Python versions:**
* python 3.8
* python 3.9
* python 3.10

**Python versions:**

All pip dependencies are in the `Pipfile` file.

### Users
You can install `squirrel` with pip
```sh
pip install squirrel-writer
```

### Devs
Grab the repo, install dependencies, and voila.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/squirrel-writer/squirrel
cd squirrel
pipenv install --dev && pipenv shell
# Install the package in editable mode
# use pip with this command, so that Pipfile doesn't get modified
pip install -e .

# To run unittests
pytest
# Or use tox to run tests on multiple versions
tox
```
## Usage
### Commands
There 4 main verbs to interact with squirrel:
* init
* watch
* set
* overview

You can learn more about their options with `-h` or `--help` option. (e.g `squirrel init -h`, etc.)
#### Init
```sh
squirrel init -n Assay --project-type text
```
#### Set
Set can be used after init to change or set fields.
```sh
squirrel set --name "English Assay" --goal 10000 --due 05/01/2022
```
#### Watch
Run this command to tell squirrel to watch your writing.
```sh
squirrel watch start --daemon
squirrel watch status
squirrel watch stop
```

#### Overview
`overview` displays your writing progress.
```sh
# A general overview
squirrel overview
# to get a barchart
squirrel overview --graph
```

### Ignore files
Similar to `.gitignore` files in git repos, you can ignore files in `squirrel` projects
by adding a `.squirrelignore` file in the root of your project.

Note that `.*`, `*~`, `*~` and `.<dir>` are ignored by default

Example file structure:
* .squirrel/
* thesis.tex
* .squirrelignore

```
# .squirrelignore file

# How to ignore files and file types
*.tmp
README.md

# How to ignore directories
tmp_dir/
```

## Contributors

### How can you help
If you're looking to help `squirrel` become better, we're always looking
for people to test, report any bugs, improve documentation,
and submit any fixes or features.
Any contribution (even documentation) goes a long way.

### Pull Requests
PRs are welcome :). Make sure to open an issue before submitting the
PR so that everybody can chip in with their opinion.

If your PR with be changing some dependencies, don't forget to update `Pipfile.lock` as well as the dependencies in `setup.py` with `pipenv-setup`.

### Plugins
All plugins are located in `squirrel/plugins`. Each plugin has its own directory, which has in it the Python module (e.g `example_plugin.py`) and the `yaml` config file.
The `yaml` file stores:
* metadata of the plugin
* any dependencies the plugin needs to work properly.

An example plugin can be found in `squirrel/plugins/example_plugin/`.

#### How to Write Plugins:

Every plugin you create must have a `get_count(files) -> int` function in their module that counts all the files and returns an int.
For squirrel to find your plugin and be able to load it, the plugin must respect a structure.

**Plugin Structure**:

There are 2 main files that make plugins work correctly. A `.py` file/module that contains the `get_count` function and a `.yaml` config file.
The folder that contains the plugin, the plugin itself (e.g python module), and the config file should have the same name.

For example, if you are creating a plugin called `markdowncount`, this is how it should be structured:

	- plugins/
		- markdowncount/
			- markdowncount.py
			- markdowncount.yaml

And the files might look like this:
```Python
# markdowncount.py
def get_count(files) -> int:
	return ...
```
```yaml
name: markdowncount
description: ....
version: 0.0.1
```
Look at this example for [more](https://github.com/squirrel-writer/squirrel/blob/plugin/squirrel/plugins/example_plugin/example_plugin.yaml) detail.


**Third-party requirements**:

If a plugin needs some thrid-party dependencies (`system` or `pip`), they must be declared in the `yaml` config file of the plugin.

`pip` or `system` dependencies can be declared this way inside the config file:
```yaml
deps:
  sys:
   - texcount
  pip:
   - panda
```

### Testing
The testing suite is very small at the moment (about 7 tests).
We need help in making it robust and exhaustive. Any contribution on this regard is highly appreciated.

`squirrel` is still in an experimental stage. Bugs are probably present, so any testing and bug reporting is welcome.
