# ‚ùî About

[yamlfixer](https://github.com/opt-nc/yamlfixer) automates the fixing
of problems reported by
[yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) by parsing its
output.

# üìë Prerequisites

üí° **You can try the install process online thanks to the dedicated [Katacoda scenario](https://www.katacoda.com/opt-labs/courses/devops-tools/yamlfixer).**

In order for it to work, `yamlfixer` needs that the following
utilities are already installed on your system, in a directory present
in your `$PATH` :

- [x] `Python v3.6` (or higher)
- [x] `yamllint v1.26.3` (or higher)

Then simply install `yamlfixer` from [pypi](https://pypi.org/)

```shell
python3 -m pip install yamlfixer-opt-nc
```


# üöÄ Usage

This software automatically fixes some errors and warnings reported by
`yamllint`.



```shell
$ yamlfixer [--debug] [--verbose] [--backup] *.yml - thisfile.yaml
```

or:

```shell
$ yamlfixer [--help] [--version]
```

This will launch `yamllint` on each specified filename, then parse its
output and try to fix the reported problems. The special filename `-`
means `stdin`, and is assumed if there's no other filename argument.

If input is read from `stdin`, the corrected output will be sent to
`stdout`.
Other files will be overwritten if needed. Original files,
`stdin` excepted, can be preserved as `.orig` if the `--backup`
command line option is used.

Diagnostic information is sent to stderr in verbose or debug modes.

This command exits with `-2` if yamllint is not available on your
system. Otherwise it exits with `0` if all input files either are
skipped or successfully pass `yamllint` strict mode, else `-1`.

**IMPORTANT:** Not all problems are fixable by `yamlfixer`. Due to the
fact that `yamllint` doesn't currently report all faulty lines,
`yamlfixer` might even introduce indentation problems under some
circumstances.
