Typical ML workflows include multiple steps, e.g. pre-processing data, training, fine-tuning, validation, etc. With
`dstack`, you can define ML workflows in a simple YAML format, and run them via the CLI over a pool of your own servers or
on-demand servers in your cloud.

### How dstack works

1. You define `.dstack/workflows.yaml` and `.dstack/variables.yaml` files inside your project (must be a Git repository)
   .

2. You install the `dstack` CLI via `pip`.
3. You either install `dstack-runner` daemon on your servers, or use the `dstack aws confi` to authorize dstack to
   use your own cloud to create on-demand runners.
4. You use the `dstack` CLI to run workflows, manage runs, jobs, logs, artifacts, runners.

5. When a workflow is submitted via the CLI (e.g. via `dstack run`) , the request is sent to the dstack server. The dstack
   server creates jobs for the submitted run, and assign them to available runners (either servers where you've
   installed dstack-runner or on-demand spot instances in your cloud that you allowed creating).
6. Runners execute assigned jobs, report their logs in real time, and upload artifacts once the job is finished.
