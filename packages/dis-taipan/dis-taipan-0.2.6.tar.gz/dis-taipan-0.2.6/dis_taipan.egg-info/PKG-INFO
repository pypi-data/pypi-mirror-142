# dis-taipan  ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dis-taipan)

50% Sis-snek features that are either too undercooked for merging into the library proper
50%  "application specific" common code I want to use in most of my bots, but don't fit the philosophy of dis-snek itself.

A taipan is a dangerous australian snake.  I thought it was mildly amusing.

```
pip install dis-taipan
```
