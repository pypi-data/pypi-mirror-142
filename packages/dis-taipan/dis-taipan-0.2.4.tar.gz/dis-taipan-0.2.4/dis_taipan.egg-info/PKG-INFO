# dis-taipan  ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dis-taipan)

This is basically a bunch of "application specific" common code I want to use in most of my bots, and got sick of updating multiple times when I found bugs/improvements.

Feel free to use it, or send PRs if you want to

```
pip install dis-taipan
```
