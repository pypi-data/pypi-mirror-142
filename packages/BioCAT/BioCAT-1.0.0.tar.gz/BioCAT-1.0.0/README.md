# BioCAT: Biosynthesis Cluster Analysis Tool
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53526550/132544644-86306499-133d-44e2-8e4c-e2603fb7d0f0.png" width="205" height="145" align="left">BioCAT is a tool which is designed for searching potential producers of a given non-ribosomal peptide. The tool performs an alignment of the given NRP chemical structure against all possible biosytnthesis gene clusters (BGCs) found in the given genome and returns the final alignment score distributed from 0 to 1. Alignments with score higher than 0.5 can be considered as successful matches.

Identification of monomers is performed with the rBAN tool(https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0335-x). Annotation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters is preformed with the antiSMASH 6 software(https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/W1/W29/6274535).
## **Dependencies:**
- antiSMASH 6
- sklearn 0.24.2
- pandas
- biopython
- numpy
- rdkit
- hmmer

rBAN is included into the BioCAT package.

## **Installation:**

```
conda create -n biocat_env -c bioconda -c rdkit antismash=6 hmmer rdkit
conda activate biocat_env
pip install biocat
```

## **BioCAT usage:**

There is no test data in the BioCAT package distributed via Pip. Several examples are available in this repository in the `example` folder.

### Usage example:

For a minimal run, an NRP structure in SMILES format and a genome in FASTA format must be specified with the `-smiles` and `-genome` parameters, respectively. Optionally, you can specify the output directory using the `-out` parameter and the name of the given NRP using `-name`.

``` 
biocat -smiles '[H][C@@]1(CCC(O)=O)NC(=O)CC(CCCCCCCCCCC)OC(=O)[C@]([H])(CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@@]([H])(CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@]([H])(CC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@@]([H])(NC(=O)[C@@]([H])(CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@]([H])(CC(C)C)NC1=O)C(C)C' -name 'surfactin' -genome example/Surfactin/GCF_000015785.2_ASM1578v2_genomic.fna -out surfactin_results 
```
In this case, the given chemical structure of surfactin is processed by rBAN and the given genome is processed by antiSMASH 6. Next, the resulting files are used for the alignment process. The main feature of BioCAT is a PSSM-based alignment algorithm, which includes an artificial shuffling of PSSMs to calculate the final score, so, the alignment process might be time-consuming in some cases (usually less than 1 minute).

The output directory `surfactin_results` contains the rBAN and the antiSMASH resulting files, PSSM matrices generated for BGCs which were aligned during the analysis, and the resulting file `Results.tsv`.
This file contains a detailed information about each possible NRP to BGC alignment, but in this minimal example we are interested only in the last two columns `Relative score` and `Binary`. Rows with relative score more than 0.5 are interpreted as successful alignments, thus, the given organism can be considered as a potential producer of surfactin.

BioCAT is a tool, which estimates the likelihood that a given orgnism is
capable of producing of a given NRP

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Genome arguments:
  -antismash ANTISMASH  antiSMASH *.json output file (either -antismash or
                        -genome parameter should be specified)
  -genome GENOME        Path to the fasta file with nucleotide sequence
                        (either -antismash or -genome parameter should be
                        specified)

Chemical arguments:
  -name NAME            Name of the given molecule (optional)
  -smiles SMILES        NRP chemical structure in the SMILES format (either
                        -smiles or -file_smiles parameter should be specified)
  -file_smiles FILE_SMILES
                        .smi file with one or more NRPs. Each row should
                        contain two columns: name of the NRP and SMILES
                        string. Columns should be separated by tabulation.
                        (Either -smiles or -file_smiles parameter should be
                        specified.)
  -rBAN RBAN            rBAN peptideGraph.json output file
  -NRPS_type NRPS_TYPE  Expected NRPS type (default A+B)

Technical arguments:
  -iterations ITERATIONS
                        Count of shuffling iterations (default 100)
  -delta DELTA          The maximum number of gaps in the molecule (default
                        3). Gaps are assigned as "nan".
  -threads THREADS      Number of threads (default 8)
  -out OUT              Output directory (default ./BioCAT_output)

Advanced arguments:
  -skip SKIP            Count of modules which can be skipped (default 0). Not
                        recommended to use unless the user is sure about
                        module skipping.
  --disable_pushing_type_B
                        By defult, the algorithm tries to truncate peptide
                        fragments cutting edge monomers to find all possible
                        identical peptide fragments in the structure. If
                        disabled, only the identity of full peptide fragments
                        is considered.
  --disable_dif_strand  By default, the protoclusters predicted by antiSMASH
                        are subdivided according to the assumption that each
                        cluster should contain only genes located on the same
                        strand of the genome. If disabled, protoclusters
                        annotated by antiSMASH are used as minimal clusters.
  --disable_exploration
                        By default, the algorithm tries to find the optimal
                        alignment combining alignment options in all possible
                        ways. If disabled, alignment is performed in according
                        to the given options strictly.
