**Public beartype decorator.**

This private submodule defines the core :func:`beartype` decorator, which the
:mod:`beartype.__init__` submodule then imports for importation as the public
:mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator by downstream callers -- completing the
virtuous cycle of code life.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

# All "FIXME:" comments for this submodule reside in this package's "__init__"
# submodule to improve maintainability and readability here.

#FIXME: @TeamSpen210 had a great idea to literally reduce @beartype to a space-
#and time-efficient noop under "not __debug__" builds:
#    ...you could move the __debug__ check into beartype.__init__, and then
#    only import the actual core components if __debug__ is off. Then in
#    "optimised" mode, most of beartype won't even need to be loaded, probably
#    just the config if anything.

    '''
    Decorate the passed **beartypeable** (i.e., pure-Python callable or class)
    with optimal type-checking dynamically generated unique to that
    beartypeable under the passed beartype configuration.

    Specifically:

    * If the passed object is a callable, this decorator dynamically generates
      and returns a **runtime type-checker** (i.e., pure-Python function
      validating all parameters and returns of all calls to the passed
      pure-Python callable against all PEP-compliant type hints annotating
      those parameters and returns). The type-checker returned by this
      decorator is:

      * Optimized uniquely for the passed callable.
      * Guaranteed to run in ``O(1)`` constant-time with negligible constant
        factors.
      * Type-check effectively instantaneously.
      * Add effectively no runtime overhead to the passed callable.

    * If the passed object is a class, this decorator iteratively applies
      itself to all annotated methods of this class by dynamically wrapping
      each such method with a runtime type-checker (as described above).

    If optimizations are enabled by the active Python interpreter (e.g., due to
    option ``-O`` passed to this interpreter), this decorator silently reduces
    to a noop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : Optional[BeartypeableT]
        **Beartypeable** (i.e., pure-Python callable or class) to be decorated.
        Defaults to ``None``, in which case this decorator is in configuration
        rather than decoration mode. In configuration mode, this decorator
        creates and returns an efficiently cached private decorator that
        generically applies the passed beartype configuration to any
        beartypeable object passed to that decorator. Look... It just works.
    conf : BeartypeConf, optional
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all flags, options, settings, and other metadata configuring the
        current decoration of the decorated callable or class). Defaults to
        ``BeartypeConf()``, the default beartype configuration.

    Returns
    ----------
    BeartypeableT
        Either:

        * If the passed object is a class, this existing class embellished with
          dynamically generated type-checking.
        * If the passed object is a callable, a new callable wrapping that
          callable with dynamically generated type-checking.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeConfException
        If the passed configuration is *not* actually a configuration (i.e.,
        instance of the :class:`BeartypeConf` class).
    BeartypeDecorHintException
        If any annotation on this callable is neither:

        * A **PEP-compliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with a
          PEP supported by :mod:`beartype`), including:

          * :pep:`484` types (i.e., instance or class declared by the stdlib
            :mod:`typing` module).

        * A **PEP-noncompliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with
          :mod:`beartype`-specific semantics rather than a PEP), including:

          * **Fully-qualified forward references** (i.e., strings specified as
            fully-qualified classnames).
          * **Tuple unions** (i.e., tuples containing one or more classes
            and/or forward references).
    BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
        If :pep:`563` is active for this callable and evaluating a **postponed
        annotation** (i.e., annotation whose value is a string) on this
        callable raises an exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to
        local state no longer accessible from this deferred evaluation).
    BeartypeDecorParamNameException
        If the name of any parameter declared on this callable is prefixed by
        the reserved substring ``__beartype_``.
    BeartypeDecorWrappeeException
        If this callable is either:

        * Uncallable.
        * A class, which :mod:`beartype` currently fails to support.
        * A C-based callable (e.g., builtin, third-party C extension).
    BeartypeDecorWrapperException
        If this decorator erroneously generates a syntactically invalid wrapper
        function. This should *never* happen, but here we are, so this probably
        happened. Please submit an upstream issue with our issue tracker if you
        ever see this. (Thanks and abstruse apologies!)

Non-thread-safe **beartype decorator cache.**

This cache is implemented as a singleton dictionary mapping from each
**beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating all
flags, options, settings, and other metadata configuring the current decoration
of the decorated callable or class) to the corresponding **configured beartype
decorator** (i.e., closure created and returned from the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when passed a beartype configuration via
the optional ``conf`` parameter rather than an object to be decorated via
the optional ``obj`` parameter).

Caveats
----------
**This cache is not thread-safe.** Although rendering this cache thread-safe
would be trivial, doing so would needlessly reduce efficiency. This cache is
merely a runtime optimization and thus need *not* be thread-safe.
