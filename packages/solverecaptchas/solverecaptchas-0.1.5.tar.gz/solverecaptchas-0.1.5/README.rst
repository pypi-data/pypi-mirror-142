Trained model
----------------
I've trained a model that detects each of the following classes which support 9x grid.

1. bicycle
2. boat
3. bridge
4. bus
5. car

This model can be downloaded from https://mikey.id/yolov3.weights. I've provided the other necessary files under **model/**.

Compatibility
-------------

Linux, macOS, and Windows!

Installation
------------

.. code:: shell

   $ pip install solverecaptchas

Usage
-----

If you want to use it in your own script

.. code:: python

     import asyncio
     import sys

     from solverecaptchas.solver import Solver

     if len(sys.argv) == 4:
          pageurl, sitekey, proxy = sys.argv[1:]
     else:
          print('Invalid number of arguments (pageurl, sitekey, proxy)')
          sys.exit(0)

     if proxy.lower() == "none":
          proxy = None

     client = Solver(pageurl, sitekey, proxy=proxy)
     result = asyncio.run(client.start())
     if result:
          print(result)
