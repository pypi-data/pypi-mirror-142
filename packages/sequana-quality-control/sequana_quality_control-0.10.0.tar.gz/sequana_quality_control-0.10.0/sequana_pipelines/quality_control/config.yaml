# Quality trimming and adapter removal
#
# For adapter removal, the fwd and rev fields are used. It can be a
# string, or a filename. If a filename, it must be prefixed with "file:" to
# specify that it is a file and not a string. If the tool is cutadapt, the empty
# fwd and rev fields means that no adapters are to be used.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - fwd: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - m: 20 means discard trimmed reads that are shorter than 20.
#         must be > 0
# - quality: 0 means no trimming, 30 means keep base with quality
#        above 30
# - mode: must be set to one of
#     - g for 5'
#     - a for 3'
#     - b for both 5'/3'
# - rev: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - tool: only cutadapt supported for now
# - threads: number of threads to use (atropos only)
# - options: See cutadapt documentation for details on
#            cutadapt.readthedocs.io. We change the default value
