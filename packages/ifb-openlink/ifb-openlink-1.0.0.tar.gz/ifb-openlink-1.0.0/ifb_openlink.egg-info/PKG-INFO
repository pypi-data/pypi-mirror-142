# OpenLink - A gateway for research data management plateform

[![pipeline](https://gitlab.com/igbmc/openlink/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/igbmc/openlink/-/commits/master)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openlink/badge/?version=latest)](https://openlink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

OpenLink is a web application designed to provide the researcher with a clear view of the data associated with each research project.
It reduces the barriers to adopting the FAIR principles and assists researchers in publishing data

OpenLink let's you create links between the structure of a research project described using the [ISA model](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) (Investigatio, Study, Assay) and multiple data sources.
It supports an evolving collection of data sources including LabGuru, Omero, Seafile, SSH endpoints and Zenodo. It also embed features that facilitate data manipulation and assist researchers in publishing their data.

OpenLink has been developped within Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire ([IGBMC](https://www.igbmc.fr/)) at Strasbourg, France. 
The proof of concept has been funded by ANR in 2019 and since 2021, The French Institut of Bioinformatic ([IFB](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/)) is funding OpenLink in order to make it a more mature product.

## Openlink installation

This section describes the best way to install Openlink.

Openlink releases can be downloaded from [Pypi]() or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/igbmc/openlink)

### Requirements

Openlink requires Python 3.6 or later

### Install openlink package

The recommended way of installing Openlink is via pip inside a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ifb-openlink
```

### Initializing the Openlink database

OpenLink supports MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. See the complete guide on [configuring Openlink](configuration.md) for more details. By default, Openlink will use SQLite and create a database file in your current working directory.

After configuring your database of choice you must first initialize the Openlink database. This should only be done once:

```bash
openlink migrate
```

### Add a superuser and start openlink server

Add a superuser account in your database by running the following command:

```bash
openlink createsuperuser
```

### Start Redis Queue worker

Openlink is able to handle asynchronous tasks in the background using RQ workers.
You can find documentation on installing a Redis server on [the Redis website](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)

Once Redis is installed and runnning, start OpenLink RQ worker with the following command:

```bash
python openlink rqworker default
```

### Start Openlink server

Use `runserver` command to quickly start a developpement web server:

```bash
openlink runserver
```

OpenLink is now running.

Point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and login with the super user account you created.
