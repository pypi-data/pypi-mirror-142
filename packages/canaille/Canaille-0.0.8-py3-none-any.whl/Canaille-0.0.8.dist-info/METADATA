**Canaille** is a French word meaning *rascal*. It is roughly pronounced **Can I?**,
as in *Can I access your data?* Canaille is a simple account manager and an OpenID Connect provider based upon a LDAP database.

It aims to be very light, simple to install and simple to maintain. Its main features are :
- Authentication and user profile edition against a LDAP directory;
- "I forgot my password" emails;
- Only OpenID Connect: no outdated or exotic protocol support;
- No additional database required: everything is stored in your LDAP server;
- Customizable, themable;
- The code is easy to read and easy to edit, and you should!
