        The *quickly* python package is able to create and manipulate LilyPond music
        documents. LilyPond documents often use the ``.ly`` extension, hence the name.
        
        It is currently in an early development stage, but slated to become the
        successor of the `python-ly`_ package. Like python-ly, it provides tools to
        manipulate `LilyPond`_ music documents, but instead of using the lexer in
        python-ly, which is very difficult to maintain, it uses the new `parce`_
        package for parsing `LilyPond`_ files.
        
        ``ly.dom`` and ``ly.music`` are superseded by ``quickly.dom`` which provides a
        way to both build a LilyPond source file from scratch (like ``ly.dom``) and
        manipulate an existing document (like ``ly.music``). Most of the functionality
        that in python-ly is implemented at the token level, like transposing and
        rhythm manipulations, now works on the musical representation provided by
        ``quickly.dom``, which looks a lot like ``ly.music``.
        
        This module is written and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen, and will, as it
        grows, also contain (adapted) code from python-ly that was contributed by
        others. Python 3.6 and higher is supported. Besides Python itself the most
        recent version of the *parce* module is needed. Testing is done by running
        ``pytest-3`` in the root directory.
        
        The documentation reflects which parts are already working :-) Enjoy!
