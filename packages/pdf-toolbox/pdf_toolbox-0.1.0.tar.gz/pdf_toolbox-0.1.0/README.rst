PDF TOOLBOX
===========

This package is designed to be used as an extensible library.

**PDF TOOLBOX allows extracting, parsing, structuring and storing text from PDFs.**

This package emerges as the solution to a challenge in which I
had to obtain and store clinical data but can be used for any other purpose.

Package installation
====================

Download and install this package.
To install this package you should run:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 setup.py install


Extracting PDF Text
===================

PDF TOOLBOX it is designed to read PDFs from multiple sources.

The `pdf.readers.filereader` module implements the reading of PDFs stored as files.
To read PDFs stored in memory, in a rabbitmq or in another data source,
it is necessary to create your own implementation that respects the
interface defined in `pdf.domain.pdfreader`.

**Example usage**

Retrieving text from a PDF file:

.. code-block:: python

  from pdf_toolbox.pdf.readers.filereader import FilePDFReader

  pdf_reader = FilePDFReader("inputs/report.pdf")

  pdf_text = pdf_reader.extract_text()


Parsing PDF Text
----------------

PDF text can have as parsers as PDF types are in the world.

The provided parser parses the PDF text of the challenge.
The provided parser obtains the text of a specific clinical
PDF and returns its information structured in a dictionary.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: python

  from pdf_toolbox.text_extraction.report_parsers.challenge_parser import ChallengeParser

  challenge_parser = ChallengeParser(pdf_text)
  pdf_data = challenge_parser.parse()


You can define your own parser for other PDF types by implementing the
`ReportParser` interface located in `text_extraction.domain.report_parser`.

Storing PDF parsed data
=======================

Creating an identifier for the report
-------------------------------------

Before saving the report data we should have defined an identifier for it. This package has a shortcut for it.

The method `create_id` returns a new uuid version 4 identifier.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: python

  from pdf_toolbox.shared.utils import create_id

  report_id = create_id()


Saving report data
------------------

The use of a JSON file as a storage backend is implemented in this package. 

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: python

  from pdf_toolbox.report_storage.storages.json_storage import JSONStorage

  json_storage = JSONStorage("demo.json")
  json_storage.save(pdf_data, report_id)

Any type of backend can be implemented without losing compatibility with the rest of the code. Every storage backend must implement the interface `report_storage.domain.storage.Storage`.

Running tests
=============

To run the tests of this package you must install dev_requirements.txt and
run pytest inside pdf_toolbox folder.

.. code-block:: bash
  pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
  cd pdf_toolbox
  pytest
