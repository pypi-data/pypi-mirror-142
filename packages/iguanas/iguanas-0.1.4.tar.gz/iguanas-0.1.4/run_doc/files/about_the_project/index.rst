About the project
=================

Iguanas was started as a project by James Laidler when working at Simility (which is now part of PayPal). It was developed to reduce the time the team spent on building and optimising rules for Simility's clients. 

It has now grown into a fully-fledged Python package for developing a Rules-Based System. However, it is still being actively developed, and contributors are encouraged to get involved!

Our vision
----------

**Our vision is to make Iguanas the go-to Python package developing a deployment-ready Rules-Based System (RBS) for all use cases.**

Roadmap

By the end of H1 2022, we aim to have the following completed:

* Build on the existing Iguanas pipeline module to cover more complex workflows (i.e. parallel pipelines).
* Make all modules in Iguanas Spark-ready.
* Runtime and memory improvements.
