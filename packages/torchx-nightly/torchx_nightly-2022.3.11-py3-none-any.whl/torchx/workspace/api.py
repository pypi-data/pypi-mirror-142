    Note: (Prototype) this interface may change without notice!

    A mix-in that can be attached to a Scheduler that adds the ability to
    builds a workspace. A workspace is the local checkout of the codebase/project
    that builds into an image. The workspace scheduler adds capability to
    automatically rebuild images or generate diff patches that are
    applied to the ``Role``, allowing the user to make local code
    changes to the application and having those changes be reflected
    (either through a new image or an overlaid patch) at runtime
    without a manual image rebuild. The exact semantics of what the
    workspace build artifact is, is implementation dependent.

        Builds the specified ``workspace`` with respect to ``img``
        and updates the ``role`` to reflect the built workspace artifacts.
        In the simplest case, this method builds a new image and updates
        the role's image. Certain (more efficient) implementations build
        incremental diff patches that overlay on top of the role's image.

        Note: this method mutates the passed ``role``.
