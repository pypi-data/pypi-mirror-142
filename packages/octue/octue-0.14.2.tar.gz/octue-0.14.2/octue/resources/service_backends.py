"""The names of backend classes must end with "Backend" to be registered as valid backends for the `Child` class.
Beyond that, a backend class can store whatever data it needs to authenticate and specify resources for the specific
backend it represents. Credentials should not be stored directly in a backend instance, but storing the names of
environment variables that store credentials is fine. For a backend to be valid, it must have a corresponding entry in
the "oneOf" field of the "backend" key of the children schema in `Twined`, which is located at
`twined/schema/children_schema.json`.
