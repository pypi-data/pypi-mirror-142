    How do I make a good changelog?
    ===============================

    Guiding Principles
    ------------------

    - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
    - There should be an entry for every single version.
    - The same types of changes should be grouped.
    - Versions and sections should be linkable.
    - The latest version comes first.
    - The release date of each version is displayed.
    - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

    Types of changes

    - **Added** for new features.
    - **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
    - **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.
    - **Removed** for now removed features.
    - **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
    - **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.
