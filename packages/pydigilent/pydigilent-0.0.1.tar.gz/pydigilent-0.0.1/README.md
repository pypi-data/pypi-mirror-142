# Py Digilent

This repository contains an object oriented library for Digilent devices. It is written in Python 3 and has typing information. Typing means this library incompatible with earlier python versions.

This library has been developed and tested with the Digilent Analog Discovery 2. The library is written to support any digilent device supported by the digilent SDK. Class properties are generated at runtime based upon the connected hardware.
