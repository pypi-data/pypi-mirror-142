## nepali-to-roman
## Package to convert Nepali text to romanized English.
While working with many Nepali documents, we encountered lots of data of Nepali names which includes names, surname, address and number
Extracting the data was not a easy task but working with its romanize transliteration was hard.

Many different packages are created for transliteration but they were not quite accurate.

This package contains large amount of Nepali litral and words which are mapped to its respective romanized literal and word.

But that was not the challenging part, still it was not giving the accurate result for instance
"नेपाल" was showing Nepala as the "ल" is mapped as "la".
So we have worked with these type of issues also.
