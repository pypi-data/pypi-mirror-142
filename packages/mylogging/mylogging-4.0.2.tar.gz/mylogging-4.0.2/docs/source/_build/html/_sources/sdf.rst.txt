My python warn-logging module. It log to console or it can log to file if configured.

1) It's automatically colorized
2) It's possible to control logs and warnings behaviour (ignore, once, always) as in warnings.
3) It's possible to filter messages by level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
