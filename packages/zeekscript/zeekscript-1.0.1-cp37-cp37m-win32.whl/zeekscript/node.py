class Node:
    """A relative of tree_sitter.Node.

    This class represents nodes in the syntax tree. A subset of its members
    match those of tree_sitter.Node. Instances provide separate navigational
    data structures for abstract and concrete nodes (such as comments, newlines)
    in the source, and a few helper methods.

    We don't inherit from tree_sitter.Node because we can't: doing so yields
    TypeError: type 'tree_sitter.Node' is not an acceptable base type. One also
    cannot instantiate its nodes manually.

    A distinction of CST and AST runs through this class. This distinction is
    not strictly the textbook one, where the AST abstracts away syntactical
    features not useful for language processing, and it also differs slightly
    from that used in the TS docs. In this class, the AST is the CST without any
    nodes that fall under TS's "extra" category, i.e., grammar constructs that
    can occur anywhere in the language, including named symbols. For Zeek,
    examples include newlines and comments.
