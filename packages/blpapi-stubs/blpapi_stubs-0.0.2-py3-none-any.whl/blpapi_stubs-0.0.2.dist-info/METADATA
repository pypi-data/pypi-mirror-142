# blpapi-stubs

Mypy stubs for [blpapi](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/).

## Note

The latest version `3.18.0` of blpapi (2022-03-03) is typed; you really only need these stubs if using an older version: `3.17.1` or earlier.

## Installation

````console
python -m pip install blpapi-stubs
````

It is not necessary to modify your `config.ini` as the files are placed alongside their `.py` counterparts.
