## About it
PDFsak (PDF Swiss Army knife) is an utility to manipulate PDF files.

The previous name of the project (as of 2021-10-10) was "pdftools".

It allows you to:

* Merge
* N-up pages (put more than one input page into a single output page)
* Trim pages
* Extract pages
* Rotate pages
* Swap pages
* Delete pages
* Create handouts
* Add text (like page numbers)
* Remove owner protection (the one which allows you to open the file without a password, but not to print, annotate or copy from it)
* Remove metadata
* Simulate Adobe Acrobat Clearscan: vectorize the text to improve quality and readability
* Add watermarks or images
* And more

PDFsak has been tested on Windows and Linux (Fedora).

It should work also on macOS, although it has not been tested on this platform.
