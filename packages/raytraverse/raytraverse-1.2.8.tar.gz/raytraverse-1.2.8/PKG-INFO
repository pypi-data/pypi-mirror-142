        raytraverse is a complete workflow for climate based daylight modelling,
        simulation, and evaluation of architectural spaces. Built around a wavelet
        guided adaptive sampling strategy, raytraverse can fully explore the daylight
        conditions throughout a space with efficient use of processing power and
        storage space.

        Installation
        ------------
        The easiest way to install raytraverse is with pip::
        
            pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
            pip install raytraverse
        
        or if you have cloned this repository::
        
            cd path/to/this/file
            pip install .
        
        Usage
        -----
        raytraverse includes a complete command line interface with all commands
        nested under the `raytraverse` parent command enter::
        
            raytraverse --help
        
        raytraverse also exposes an object oriented API written primarily in python.
        calls to Radiance are made through Renderer objects that wrap the radiance
        c source code in c++ classes, which are made available in python with pybind11.
        see the src/ directory for more.
        
        For complete documentation of the API and the command line interface either
        use the Documentation link included above or::
        
            pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
            make docs
        
        to generate local documentation.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        the following example script shows the basic workflow for a complete simulation
        it can be saved to a local file with::
        
            raytraverse examplescript > example.py
        
        or the file is located at raytraverse/example.py

        History
        =======
        
        1.2.4 (2021-12-03) (not posted until 2022-02-10)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        * organized command line code
        * use process pool for sun sampler when raytracing is fast (such as -ab 0 runs with dcomp)
        * propogate plotp to child sampler if sampling one level
        * separated utility command line to own entry point. fixed ambiguity in
          coordinate handedness of some functions (changed kwarg defaults)
        
        1.2.3 (2021-09-03)
        ------------------
        
         * fixed rcontrib to work with Radiance/HEAD, radiance version string includes commit
         * daylightplane - add indirect to -ab 0 sun run (daysim/5-phase style)
         * lightpointkd - handle adding points with same sample rays
         * sampler - add repeat function to follow an existing sampling scheme
         * lightresult - added print function
         * scene - remove logging from scene class
         * cli.py
            * new command imgmetric, extract rays from image and use same metricfuncs
            * mew command pull, filter and output 2d data frames from lightresult
            * add printdata option to suns, to see candidates or border
         * make TStqdm progress bar class public
         * include PositionIndex calculation in BaseMetricSet
             * new metrics: loggcr and position weighted luminance/gcr
         * skymapper: filter candidates by positive dirnorm when initialized with epw/wea
         * imagetools: parallel process image metrics, also normalize peak with some
            assumptions
         * lightresult: accept slices for findices argument
         * sunsamplerpt: at second and thrid sampling levels supplement sampling with
            spec_guide at 1/100 the threshold. helps with imterior spaces to find smaller
            patches of sun
         * positionindex: fix bug transcribed from evalglare with the positionindex below horizon
        
        
        1.2.0/2 (2021-05-24)
        --------------------
        * command line interface development
        
        1.1.2 (2021-02-19)
        ------------------
        * improved documentation
        
        1.1.0/1 (2021-02-10)
        --------------------
        * refactor code to operate on a single point at a time
        
        1.0.4 (2020-11-18)
        ------------------
        * create and manage log file (attribute of Scene) for run directories
        * possible fix for bug in interpolate_kd resulting in index range errors
        * protect imports in cli.py so documentation can be built without installing
        
        1.0.3 (2020-11-10)
        ------------------
        * new module for calculating position based on retinal features
        * view specifications for directview plotting
        * options for samples/weight visibility on directview plotting
        
        0.2.0 (2020-09-25)
        ------------------
        
        * Build now includes all radiance dependencies to setup multi-platform testing
        * In the absence of craytraverse, sampler falls back to SPRenderer
        * install process streamlined for developer mode
        * travis ci deploys linux and mac wheels directly to pypi
        * release.sh should be run after updating this file, tests past locally and
            docs build.
        
        0.1.0 (2020-05-19)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
