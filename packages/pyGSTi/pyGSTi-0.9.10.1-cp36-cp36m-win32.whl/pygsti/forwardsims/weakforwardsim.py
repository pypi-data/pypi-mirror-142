class WeakForwardSimulator(_ForwardSimulator):
    """
    A calculator of circuit outcome probabilities from a "weak" forward simulator
    (i.e. probabilites taken as average frequencies over a number of "shots").

    Due to their ability to only sample outcome probabilities, WeakForwardSimulators
    rely heavily on implementing the _compute_sparse_circuit_outcome_probabilities
    function of ForwardSimulators.

        spc_circuit : SeparatePOVMCircuit
            A tuple-like object of *simplified* gates (e.g. may include
