r"""This time you'll understand thoroughly the insides of recurrent neural
networks on a class of toy problems.

Struggle to find a name for the variable? Let's see how you'll come up with
a name for your son/daughter. Surely no human has expertize over what is
a good child name, so let us train RNN instead ;)

You should fill in the gaps in the given function templates.
