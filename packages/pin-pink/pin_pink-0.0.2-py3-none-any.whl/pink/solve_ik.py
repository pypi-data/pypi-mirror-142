    Compute the Hessian matrix :math:`H` and linear vector :math:`c` of the
    QP objective function:

    .. math::

        \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta q^T H \\Delta q + c^T q

    The configuration displacement :math:`\\Delta q` is the output of inverse
    kinematics (we divide it by :math:`\\Delta t` to get a commanded velocity).

    Args:
        robot: Robot model and its current configuration :math:`q`.
        tasks: List of kinematic tasks to fulfill at (weighted) best.
        damping: weight of Tikhonov (everywhere) regularization. Its unit is
            `[cost]^2 / [tangent]` where `[tangent]` is "the" unit of robot
            velocities. Improves numerical stability, but larger values slow
            down all tasks.

        Pair :math:`(H, c)` of Hessian matrix and linear vector of the QP
        objective.

    """
    Compute a velocity tangent to the current robot configuration that
    satisfies at (weighted) best a given set of kinematic tasks.

    This function assumes that the robot data already underwent forward
    kinematics and frame placement update. TODO(scaron): properly handled
    by ConfiguredRobot type.

    Args:
        robot: Robot model.
        tasks: List of kinematic tasks.
        dt: Integration timestep in [s].
        damping: weight of Tikhonov (everywhere) regularization. Its unit is
            :math:`[\\mathrm{cost}]^2 / [\\mathrm{tangent}]` where
            :math:`[\\mathrm{tangent}]` is "the" unit of robot velocities.
            Improves numerical stability, but larger values slow down all
            tasks.
        solver: Backend quadratic programming solver.

    Returns:
        Velocity :math:`v` in tangent space, of dimension `robot.nv`.

    Raises:
        NotWithinConfigurationLimits: if the current robot configuration is not
            within limits.

    Note:
        Our Tikhonov damping is isotropic despite tangent velocities not being
        homogeneous. If it helps we can add a tangent-space scaling to damp the
        floating base differently from joint angular velocities.
