Pink adds a notion of *configured* robot to indicate that forward kinematics
functions have been run, so that frame transforms and frame Jacobians used for
IK can be queried from the robot's data.

TODO(scaron): two versions of solve_ik, with/without configuration step.

    Type annotation indicating that quantities that depend on the configuration
    :math:`q` have been computed.

    In Pink, this type enables access to frame transforms and frame Jacobians.
    We rely on typing to make sure the proper forward kinematics functions have
    been called beforehand. In Pinocchio, these functions are:

    - ``pin.computeJointJacobians(model, data, configuration)``
    - ``pin.updateFramePlacements(model, data)``

    The former computes the full model Jacobian into ``data.J``. (It also
    computes forward kinematics, so there is no need to further call
    ``pin.forwardKinematics(model, data, configuration)``.) The latter updates
    frame placements.
