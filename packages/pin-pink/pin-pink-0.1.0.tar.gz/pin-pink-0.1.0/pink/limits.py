    """
    Compute the configuration-dependent velocity limits:

    .. math::

        v_{min}(q) \\leq v \\leq v_{max}(q)

    where :math:`q \\in {\\cal C}` is the robot's configuration and :math:`v
    \\in T_q({\\cal C})` is the velocity in the tangent space at :math:`q`.
    These velocity limits combine:

    - Configuration-independent joint velocity limits
      :math:`|\\dot{q}| \\leq \\dot{q}_{lim}`.
    - Time-derivatives of the configuration limit
      :math:`q_{min} \\leq q \\leq q_{max}`.

    Args:
        configuration: Robot configuration to read kinematics from.
        dt: Integration timestep in [s].
        config_limit_gain: gain between 0 and 1 to steer away from
            configuration limits. It is described in "Real-time prioritized
            kinematic control under inequality constraints for redundant
            manipulators" (Kanoun, 2012). More details in [this
            writeup](https://scaron.info/teaching/inverse-kinematics.html).

        Pair $(v_{max}(q), v_{min}(q))$ of velocity lower and upper bounds.
