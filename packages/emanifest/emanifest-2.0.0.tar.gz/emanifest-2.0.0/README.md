**emanifest** is a Python utility wrapper for accessing the e-Manifest API of the US Environmental Protection Agency's RCRAInfo national electronic hazardous waste management system.

**Note:** The **emanifest** package was substantially refactored after version 1.1.0 and was released as a new major version at 2.0.0. Code relying on version 1.1.0 should not upgrade to version 2.0.0 of this package without refactoring.

## Installation

**emanifest** can be installed directly from the Python package directory using pip:

```bash
pip install emanifest
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

Before using the **emanifest** package, ensure you have a RCRAInfo user account and the necessary permissions to generate an API ID and key. Make note of your ID and key somewhere safe.

To add **emanifest** to your current Python environment and authenticate your account, peform the following commands:

```python
from emanifest import emanifest as em

em.new_client('ENVIRONMENT')
em.Auth('YOUR_API_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY')
```

Your environment variable can be either **preprod** or **prod** based on your permissions. To register for a preproduction testing account, visit the [preprod site](https://rcrainfopreprod.epa.gov/rcrainfo/action/secured/login).

After authenticating, you are ready to use the full functionality of the **emanifest** package. Functions designed for use by other groups, such as regulators or industry users, will return 'Access Denied' errors if you are not authorized to view this content in RCRAInfo.

### Functions

There are ten categories of functions in the **emanifest** package. For more information about these services, visit the Swagger page of your selected environment. ([PREPROD](https://rcrainfopreprod.epa.gov/rcrainfo/secured/swagger/), [PROD](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/rcrainfoprod/secured/swagger/))

1. [All users] Authentication services
2. [All users] e-Manifest Lookup Services
3. [All users] Lookup Services
4. [All users] Site Services
5. [Industry users] e-Manifest Services
6. [Industry users] e-Manifest UI Link Services
7. [Regulator users] CM&E Evaluation Services
8. [Regulator users] e-Manifest Services
9. [Regulator users] Handler Services
10. [Regulator users] User Services

Content will be returned as a JSON object. Functions that download file attachments will store these in the same folder as your Python document. Functions that update, correct, or save manifests by uploading new .json and/or .zip files must receive the specific location of these files on your computer. By default, these functions will assume the files are located in the same folder as your Python document.

After authenticating your account, you can complete a variety of actions within the e-Manifest system. For example, you might start with a new site by getting its basic details:

```python
em.GetSiteDetails('VATEST000001')
```
Once you've confirmed this is the correct site, you might search for manifests in transit from that site:

```python
em.SearchMTN(siteId='VATEST000001', status='InTransit')
```
If one of those manifests didn't match your records, you could initiate a correction with the correct JSON information and optionally any attachments (.zip):

```python
em.Correct('manifest_file_name.json', 'optional_attachments.zip')
```

### Help

If you are uncertain how to use a function, run help(em.FunctionName) in your Python environment. This will return a description of the function, any required inputs, and the formats of those inputs. For a list of all the functions contained in **emanifest** and additional information about this package, run help(emanifest) in your Python environment.
