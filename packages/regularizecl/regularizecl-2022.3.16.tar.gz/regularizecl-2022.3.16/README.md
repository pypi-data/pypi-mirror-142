============

**regularize angular power spectra**

This is a minimal Python package for regularising the angular power spectra of
multiple correlated spherical random fields.

The package can be installed using pip:

    pip install regularizecl

Then import the `regularize_cls` function from the package:

    from regularizecl import regularize_cls

For more information, please see the [documentation].

Current functionality covers the absolutely minimal use case.  Please open an
issue on GitHub if you would like to see anything added.
