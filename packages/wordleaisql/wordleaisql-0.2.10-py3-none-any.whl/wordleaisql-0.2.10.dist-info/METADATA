WORDLE AI with SQL Backend
==========================
[![](https://badge.fury.io/py/wordleaisql.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/wordleaisql)
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/kota7/wordleai-sql/main/streamlit/app.py)

This package provides an [Worldle]((https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)) solver with SQL backend.

## How to use

```shell
# Install this library via PyPI
pip install wordleaisql
# Then run the executable that comes with the library
wordleai-sql

# Alternatively, clone this repository and run without pip-install
python wordleai-sql.py
```


## Solver session example

```shell
$ wordleai-sql

'month' should be the answer!
Thank you!

## Suggestion criteria

Input words are evaludated by the three criteria as follows: 

- "max_n": Maximum number of the candidate words that would remain.
- "mean_n": Average number of the candidate words that would remain.
- "mean_entropy": Average of the log2 of number of the candidate words that would remain.

Note that if there are `n` candidate words with the equal probability, then probability of each word `i` is `p_i = 1/n`.
Then, the entropy is given by `-sum(p_i log2(p_i)) = - n * (1/n) log2(1/n) = log2(n)`.
Hence, the average of `log2(n)` can be seen as the average entropy.

"mean_entropy" is often used in practice and thus set as the default choice of the program.
"max_n" can be seen as a pessimistic criterion since it reacts to the worst case.
"mean_n" can seem an intutive criterion but does not work as well as "mean_entropy" perhaps due to the skewed distribution.

See also the simulation results for a comparison of the criteria (notebook at [simulation/simulation-summary.ipynb](simulation/simulation-summary.ipynb) or view on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/kota7/wordleai-sql/blob/main/simulation/simulation-summary.ipynb)).


## Play and challenge mode

- By default, `wordleai-sql` command starts an interactive solver session.
- `wordleai-sql --play` starts a self-play game.
- `wordleai-sql --challenge` starts a competition against an AI.
- In the play and challenge mode, the answer word is chosen in accordance with the answer weight by default. One can set `--no_answer_weight` option to make all words potentially become an answer word.


## Using a custom word set

- The default word list is at [wordleaisql/vocab/wordle-vocab.txt](wordleaisql/vocab/wordle-vocab.txt). The list perhaps is compatible with [New York Times version](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
- One may use a custom word list by specifying `--vocabfile=<file path>` option.
  - A file should contain words of the same length, separated by the line break ("\n").
  - Each line may contain a nonnegative numeric value separated by a space, which is used as the relative probability that this word is chosen as the answer (in play and challenge mode). If not supecified, the word is given the weight one.
  - A file can be gzip compressed, where the filename must end with ".gz". 
  - Although not tested thoroughly, the program would work with words containing multibyte characters (with utf8 encoding) or digits.
- By default, the file name without extension is used as the `vocabname`. One may change this by `--vocabname`.
- See `vocab-examples/` folder for some examples.

```shell
# Example
wordleai-sql --vocabname myvocab --vocabfile my-vocab.txt
```


## Backend options

### SQLite with approximate evaluation (default)

```shell
wordleai-sql -b approx
```

- With `-b approx` option, we employ approximate evaluation of words by sampling input and/or answer words.
- The database setup completes quikckly since this does not require precompuation of the judge results.
- Evaluation also completes quickly since small numbers of input and/or answer words are involved in the calculation.
- Although approximate, the engine tends to provide close-to-optimal suggestions thanks to the law of large numbers.

### SQLite with full evaluation

```shell
wordleai-sql -b sqlite
```

- This engine evaluates all words using the all answer candidates.
- To enhance the calculation the engine precomputes all judge results for all word pairs on the setup.
  - The file size becomes about 8.4GB.
  - The process may take about an hour, depending on the CPU speed.
  - The time for the setup will be significantly reduced if c++ compiler command (e.g `g++` or `clang++`) is available.

### Google bigquery backend

```shell
# --vocabname is used as the dataset name
wordleai-sql -bbq --bq_credential "gcp_credentials.json" --vocabname "wordle_dataset"
```

- With `-bbq` option, we employ google bigquery as the backend SQL engine.
- We need to supply a credential json file of the GCP service account with the following permissions:
  ```
  bigquery.datasets.create
  bigquery.datasets.get
  bigquery.jobs.create
  bigquery.jobs.get
  bigquery.routines.create
  bigquery.routines.delete
  bigquery.routines.get
  bigquery.routines.update
  bigquery.tables.create
  bigquery.tables.delete
  bigquery.tables.get
  bigquery.tables.getData
  bigquery.tables.list
  bigquery.tables.update
  bigquery.tables.updateData
  ```

## Other options

See `wordleai-sql -h` for other options, which should mostly be self-explanatory.


## GUI application

- A browser application built on [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is at [streamlit/app.py](streamlit/app.py). This can be run with the following command:
  ```shell
  # install dependencies if not
  pip install pandas streamlit
  streamlit run ./streamlit/app.py
  ```
- The app is also deployed on the [streamlit cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/kota7/wordleai-sql/main/streamlit/app.py).
