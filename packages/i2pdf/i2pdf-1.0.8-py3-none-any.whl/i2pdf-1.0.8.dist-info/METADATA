# Commands

## add-metadata

                 [default: ]

  [CONFIG_NAME]  The name of the .yaml file which contains the config data.

If you wish to have metadata added to the .pdf,
you must store it in a .yaml or .yml file. 

The format of this file should be as follows:
```
/author: test author
/keywords: test keywords
```

This file should be stored in the config folder. 

## gen-dir 
Before you can combine the images to a .pdf,
you must first generate the necessary folders. 
It is possible to do this by hand, 
but this command automatically generates the folders 
in the directy in which i2pdf was called. 

The following empty folders are generated:

| Folder      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| config      | this contains the .yaml files.       |
| images   | the image files that are to be combined to a pdf        |
| pdfs      | the generated .pdf files.       |
| results | the pdf files that had metadata added .       |

## gen-pdf 
```
Arguments:
  [SAVE_NAME]  Enter the save name of the .pdf file  [default: generated]
```

Example:
```
i2pdf generate-pdf testfile
```
Place the images in this file that are to be combined to a .pdf file.
You have the option of specifying a name for the file being generated.
if no file is added, then it is automatically called generated
