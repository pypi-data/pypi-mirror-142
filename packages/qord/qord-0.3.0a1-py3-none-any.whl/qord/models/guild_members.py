    r"""Representation of a guild member.

    A guild member is simply a user that is part of a specific :class:`Guild`.
    Every guild member has an underlying :class:`User` object attached to it.

    .. note::
        This class provides shorthand properties to access the underlying user's
        data however certain properties like :attr:`.name` and :attr:`.avatar`
        have different behaviour in this class.

        For example, :attr:`.avatar` and other avatar related methods and attributes
        also consider the guild specific avatar of member for relevant functionality
        with addition to user's global avatar.

    Attributes
    ----------
    guild: :class:`Guild`
        The parent guild that this member belongs to.
    user: :class:`User`
        The user associated to this member.
    nickname: Optional[:class:`builtins.str`]
        The nickname of this member in the guild. If member has no guild
        specific nickname set, This is ``None``. See :attr:`.display_name` property
        that aids in retrieving the name more efficiently.
    guild_avatar: Optional[:class:`builtins.str`]
        The hash of avatar for this member in the guild. If member has no
        guild specific avatar set, This is ``None``. See :attr:`.display_avatar` property
        that aids in retrieving the avatar more efficiently.
    deaf: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member is deafened in voice channels.
    mute: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member is muted in voice channels.
    pending: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member has passed the membership screening.
    joined_at: :class:`datetime.datetime`
        The time when member joined the guild.
    premium_since: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]
        The time when member started boosting the guild if applicable. If member
        is not boosting the guild, This is ``None``.
    timeout_until: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]
        The time until which member is timed out and cannot interact with
        the guild. If member is not timed out, This is ``None``.

        .. note::
            This attribute may have a value set even if member is not actually
            timed out. In which case, The datetime object would be in past. See
            :meth:`.is_timed_out` check that covers all possible cases.

    role_ids: List[:class:`builtins.int`]
        The list of IDs of roles that are associated to this member.
    roles: List[:class:`Role`]
        The list of roles associated to this member.
