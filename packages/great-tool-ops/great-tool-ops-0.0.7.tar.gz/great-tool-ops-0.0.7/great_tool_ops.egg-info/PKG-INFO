# GTO

Great Tool Ops. Turn your Git Repo into Artifact Registry:
* Index your artifacts and add enrichments
* Register artifact versions
* Promote artifacts to environments
* Act on new versions and promotions in CI

**See example repo**

Check out the example repo:
https://github.com/iterative/gto-example
read README in it and try it out

# To try out the latest version

**1. Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iterative/gto.git
cd gto
```

**2. Create virtual environment named `venv`**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install python libraries
