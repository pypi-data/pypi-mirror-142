##Getting started

This script communicates with the Xolphin API to manage certificates.\
The script is pretty basic and doesnt contain much error handling.
also the output is plain json sometimes. But it gets the job done.

### Installation

Run (preferably in a venv environment):
```commandline
python3 -m pip install xcert
```

### Usage
```
usage: xcert [-h] [--create-pem filename] [--kube-secret filename] [--list-requests]
             [--retry-validation domain_name] [--download-certificate domain_name]
             [--list-certificates] [--request-status domain_name]
             [--request-certificate domain_name] [--renew-certificate domain_name]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --create-pem filename
                        Creates a .pem file with the certificate(.crt), the intermediates(.ca) and the key(.key). And a .cer file with the Certificate and the intermediates. Requires the following files: FILENAME.crt ,FILENAME.ca and FILENAME.key
  --kube-secret filename
                        Prints a kubernetes secret in yaml format generated from a cert/key. Requires a FILENAME.cer and a FILENAME.key
  --list-requests       Lists all pending requests at Xolphin
  --retry-validation domain_name
                        Triggers a validation of the certificate request with DOMAIN_NAME
  --download-certificate domain_name
                        Downloads the certificate for DOMAIN_NAME and saves it as DOMAIN_NAME.cer. Also downloads the corresponding intermediate certificates as DOMAIN_NAME.ca
  --list-certificates   Lists all current certificates at Xolphin
  --request-status domain_name
                        Gets the status of the request with the DOMAIN_NAME. If DOMAIN_NAME is "all" then list the status of all requests
  --request-certificate domain_name
                        Request a new certificate from Xolphin, and saves the generated DOMAIN_NAME.csr and DOMAIN_NAME.key
  --renew-certificate domain_name
                        Renews an existing certificate from Xolphin, and saves the generated DOMAIN_NAME.csr and DOMAIN_NAME.key

additional information:
    This program needs 2 environment variables to be set with your Xolphin credentials:
        XOLPHIN_USER='foo@bar.nl'
        XOLPHIN_PASSWORD='secret_password'
    It will use these credentials to authenticate to the Xolphin API.
```
