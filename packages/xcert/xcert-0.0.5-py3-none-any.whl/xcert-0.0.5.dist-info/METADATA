This script communicates with the Xolphin API to manage certificates.
The script is pretty basic and doesnt contain much error handling.
also the output is plain json sometimes. But it gets the job done.
What it will do:

xcert.py list-requests          # Lists all current certificates at Xolphin.
         request <domain-name>  # Request a certificate. If you request a wildcard 
                                # domain, e.g. *.fd.nl, make sure to put quotes 
                                # around the name, e.g. '*.fd.nl'.
                                # This will also create a key and a csr file in the working directory
         status <domain-name>   # Gets the status of a request. This scripts uses domain validation
                                # So it will show which CNAME to put in your DNS zone.
         validate <domain-name> # (re)validates a request, in case an earlier validation has failed somehow.
                                # Use 'xcert.py status <domain-name>' to get the new CNAME
         list-certs             # List current certificates in Xolphin
         download <domain-name> # Downloads the certificate with the domain name specified. It will also download the ca-bundle.
                                # It will save them in the current working directory as .crt and .ca file
         create-pem <filename>  # Creates a <filename>.pem from a <filename>.crt, <filename>.ca and a <filename>.key
         create-cer <filename>  # Creates a <filename>.pem from a <filename>.crt and a<filename>.ca
         kube-secret <filename> # Prints a kubernetes tls secret with a base64 encoded tls.crt and tls.key from a <filename>.cer and <filename>.key

The script relies on 2 env vars for username and password for Xolphin. So use something like :
export XOLPHIN_USER='xolphin.user@fdmediagroep.nl'
export XOLPHIN_PASSWORD='secretpassword'
```
