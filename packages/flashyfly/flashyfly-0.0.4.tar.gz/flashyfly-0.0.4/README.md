## Windows users

It is recommended to add the `flashyfly.py` to your PATH in Windows. This can be done navigating through `Settings > System > About > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environment Variables...`. Select the variable `Path` and click in `Edit...` and again in `New`. In this final step the path must be inserted with the following template `...\Flashyfly`. Then click `OK` more two times and the script is set to use.

After adding the script to the `Path` an easy way to use it while in your working directory is:

```
C:\Users\myuser\working_dir>  
```
