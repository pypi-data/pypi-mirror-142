- layout.html is a layout for sphinx_rtd_theme that does not suffer from the 'titles_only' error. If you plan to compile
  the documentation, please override the file with the same name in the sphinx_std_theme folder in your site-packages
  with this file.

- update_rtd_layout updates the layout of rtd_theme using layout.html. Must be run within this folder (etc) with the
  venv used called venv
