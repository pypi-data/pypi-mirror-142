## Overview

CodraFT is a generic signal and image processing software based on Python scientific
libraries (such as NumPy, SciPy or OpenCV) and Qt graphical user interfaces (thanks to
[guidata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guidata) and [guiqwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guiqwt) libraries).

See [documentation](https://codraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on
the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.
