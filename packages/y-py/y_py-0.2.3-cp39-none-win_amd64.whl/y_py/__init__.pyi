class YDoc:
    """
    A Ypy document type. Documents are most important units of collaborative resources management.
    All shared collections live within a scope of their corresponding documents. All updates are
    generated on per document basis (rather than individual shared type). All operations on shared
    collections happen via YTransaction, which lifetime is also bound to a document.

    Document manages so called root types, which are top-level shared types definitions (as opposed
    to recursively nested types).

    Example::

        from y_py import YDoc

        doc = YDoc()
        with doc.begin_transaction() as txn:
            text = txn.get_text('name')

    XML element data type. It represents an XML node, which can contain key-value attributes
    (interpreted as strings) as well as other nested XML elements or rich text (represented by
    `YXmlText` type).

    In terms of conflict resolution, `YXmlElement` uses following rules:

    - Attribute updates use logical last-write-wins principle, meaning the past updates are
      automatically overridden and discarded by newer ones, while concurrent updates made by
      different peers are resolved into a single value using document id seniority to establish
      an order.
    - Child node insertion uses sequencing rules from other Yrs collections - elements are inserted
      using interleave-resistant algorithm, where order of concurrent inserts at the same index
      is established using peer's document id seniority.
