PyMSM is a Python implementation of Competing Risks and Multistate models for survival data.

Features include:

- Fit a Multistate model based on survival analysis models.
- Deals with right censoring, competing events, recurrent events, left truncation, and time-dependent covariates.
- Run Monte-carlo simulations for paths emitted by the trained model and extract various summary statistics and plots.
 - Configure a pre-defined simulation model and run simulations.
 - Modularity and compatibility for different time-to-event models such as Survival Forests or other custom models.

## Installation
```console 
pip install pymsm
```

## Quick example

```python
# Load data
from pymsm.datasets import prep_rotterdam
dataset, states_labels = prep_rotterdam()

# Define terminal states
terminal_states = [3]

#Init MultistateModel
from pymsm.multi_state_competing_risks_model import MultiStateModel, default_update_covariates_function

multi_state_model = MultiStateModel(
    dataset,
    terminal_states,
    default_update_covariates_function)

# Fit to data
multi_state_model.fit()

# Run Monte-carlo simulation
all_mcs = multi_state_model.run_monte_carlo_simulation(
              sample_covariates = dataset[0].covariates.values,
              origin_state = 1,
              current_time = 0,
              max_transitions = 2,
              n_random_samples = 100)
```
