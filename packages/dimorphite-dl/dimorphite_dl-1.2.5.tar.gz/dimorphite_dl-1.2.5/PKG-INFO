Description: Dimorphite-DL 1.2.5
        ===================
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        Dimorphite-DL adds hydrogen atoms to molecular representations, as appropriate
        for a user-specified pH range. It is a fast, accurate, accessible, and modular
        open-source program for enumerating small-molecule ionization states.
        
        This version is a class object that is representative of dimorhitedl.

        QuickStart
        ----------
        
        **Edit** This edit is made by Sulstice for distribution and installation.
        
        
        ```python
        
        dimorphite_dl = DimorphiteDL()
        print(dimorphite_dl.protonate('CC(=O)O'))
        
        >>>
        ['CC(=O)[O-]']
        
        
        ```
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        Dimorphite-DL deprotonates indoles and pyrroles around pH 14.5. But these
        substructures can also be protonated around pH -3.5. Dimorphite does not
        perform the protonation.
