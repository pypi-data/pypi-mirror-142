# ghreport - Generate useful reports from GitHub repository issues

This utility generates reports that can be useful to identify issues in
your repository that may be stale, or that may need a response.

It can also generate a chart of open bug counts over time.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for build instructions, or install from PyPI.

Use `ghreport -h` for help.

For an example report, see https://github.com/gramster/ghreport/blob/main/example.html
