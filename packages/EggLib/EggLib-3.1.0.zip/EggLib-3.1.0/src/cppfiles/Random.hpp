    The generators returning floating point numbers are based on a
    version by Isaku Wada.

    Copyright 2002 Isaku Wada

    The Mersenne Twister random number generator has been ported to C++
    by Jesper Bedaux <http://www.bedaux.net/mtrand/>.

    Copyright 2003 Jasper Bedaux

    Feedback about the C++ port should be sent to Jasper Bedaux,
    see http://www.bedaux.net/mtrand/ for e-mail address and info.

    The interface was revised and non-uniform random number generators
    have been included from the Random class of EggLib v2.1.3

    * This class implements the Mersenne Twister algorithm for

    * Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (see <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-MAT/MT/emt.html>)
    * and Jasper Bedaux (see <http://www.bedaux.net/mtrand/>) for the

    * conversion to other laws than uniform.
    *
    * Note that different instances of the class have independent chain
    * of pseudo-random numbers. If several instances have the same seed,
    * they will generate the exact same chain of pseudo-random numbers.
    * Note that this applies if the default constructor is used and that
    * instances are created within the same second.
    *
    * All non-uniform distribution laws generators are based either on
    * the rand_int32() or the standard (half-open, 32 bit) uniform()
    * methods.
