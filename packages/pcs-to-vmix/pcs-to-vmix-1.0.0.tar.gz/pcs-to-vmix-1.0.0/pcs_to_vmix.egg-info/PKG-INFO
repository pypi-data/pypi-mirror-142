## Push to PyPi

### Setup

Require twine installed
```
pip install twine
```
You also need to be able to `pip install -e .` your package so have a valid `setup.py`  

Essentially you are putting a `.gz` file on a web server that contains all the assets.  
* Create the `.gz`/`.zip` (sdist - source, bdist - binary)
* Check the nicities of it like README renders on PyPi ok etc. 
* Push to PyPi test (an "rc" release?)/ procuction (a "formal" release)
# TODO
# Look at [https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/)
```
# python setup.py build
python setup.py sdist bdist
# _wheel

twine check dist/*
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
twine upload dist/*
```
